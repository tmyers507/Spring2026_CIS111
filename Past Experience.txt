I have extensive experience with computer hardware, having built and reconfigured many PCs for gaming, video editing, and coding.

I use macOS and Windows every day, I have a little experience in Linux but have not used it extensively.

I have experience in the Microsoft 365 Suite, the Adobe Creative Suite, wire-framing software like Figma, as well as coding software like VSCode.

I am fluent in HTML and CSS and semi-fluent in Javascript.

The main mobile apps I use are Google, Apple Music, YouTube, Apple Maps, and Reddit.
